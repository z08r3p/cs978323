A Suggestion on Information to be Presented for Each Question 
For each problem, for example, Problem 4:
1. Equation derivations:
1) What equation do you use in your coding?
2)   Also give all the coefficients, and source terms   (e.g.   external   force/voltage),   as necessary.
2. What initial conditions, boundary conditions, time periods, domain size,   etc.,   (computational conditions) are used? Provide schematic diagrams as necessary.
3. Main programme:
Provide the coding below, with necessary comments.
4. Functions
1) Give information on what is this function used   for,   and what   equation   is   solved, related   to   point   1.
2) Provide the coding below, with necessary comments.
5. Results
1) Present the results required by each question, which   can be numbers, data tables,   figures,   as appropriate.
2) Comments and analysis   of   the results:
If   required   by   a   question, then   you   need   to   do   this.
If   not   required, you   can   still   do   this   if   you   wish, which   is   great!
If   you   think   it   is   necessary   to   clarify   your   results   and   methods   used, then   please   provide your comments.
